 * G9 — Diff Always Explains "What Changed"

 * Golden test to ensure that diff operations provide complete information
 * about what changed, not vague or cosmetic-only output.
 *
 * Scenario: A segment is edited.
 *
 * TODO: Implement when diff engine is added to core-domain.
 * This test requires:
 * - diffSegment function
 * - Diff result type with before/after values and change category
 */
