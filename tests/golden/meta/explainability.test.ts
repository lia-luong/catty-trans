/**
 * G16 — Explainability Test (Human-Readable)
 *
 * Golden test to ensure that all system artefacts are human-readable and
 * explainable. A human reviewer must be able to answer: What changed? When?
 * Why? From where? This is not optional.
 *
 * Scenario: Reviewer inspects artefacts.
 *
 * TODO: Implement when all core features are in place.
 * This test requires:
 * - On-disk project folder structure
 * - TM files with readable format
 * - Snapshot metadata with timestamps and provenance
 * - Diff reports with complete change information
 * - Human-readable export formats
 */
